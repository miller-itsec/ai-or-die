## Module Structure

Each module (~25-35 min) follows a consistent format:

1. **Why AI Matters** for that function (industry stats, capabilities, limitations)
2. **Core AI Tools** — ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot for M365
3. **Practical Applications** — 4-5 real scenarios with example prompts and expected output
4. **Responsible AI Use** — data sensitivity, compliance, review requirements
5. **Quiz** — 5 multiple-choice questions with answer key

## Key Principles

- **AI = draft, not done** — always review AI output before using it
- **No sensitive data in prompts** — each module specifies what must never be shared
- **Prompt quality = output quality** — practical prompt engineering built into every scenario
- **Human judgment first** — AI assists, humans decide

## Format

All content is in Markdown, compatible with:
- Confluence (copy-paste ready)
- Notion
- LMS platforms (Moodle, Google Classroom)
- Custom web apps
- GitHub rendering
